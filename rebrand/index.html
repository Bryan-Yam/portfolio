Who better than the head of the lab to get that info! The design team spoke with the lab's innovation activator about <span class="font-bold">the vision, goals, and constraints for this project</span>. We also sent out a survey to current members and alumni of the lab to capture insights about their experience with lab's brand, both during their time at the lab and when applying.

We put notes on areas that we thought would fit the lab's vision and highlighted any parts that we found interesting and worth diving into further.</p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure class="object-contain"><img alt="/" src="/static/media/inspo.5ce87808cf1626ef3ba1.png"><figcaption class="text-center text-sm">Figure 2.

The design team compiled a variety of variants for each respective section, and began testing them in combinations to see what stuck. After a lot of deliberations, mixing and matching, we decided on our final typography, iconography, and colours.</p><p class="pb-5">Iconography was the easiest to decide, to keep things organized and easier for future cohorts, we went with Google Material Design Icons; they're sustainable, have many different variants and meet universal standards for icons. For the typography, <span class="font-bold">we chose to have 3 fonts; 2 sans-serif and 1 serif</span>. Originally, the plan was to have 3 sans-serif fonts, but we found that having a serif option was great for adding emphasize and giving our designs an overall "flair" to them. We chose Mulish for the body font, as it's the main font of corporate WSIB, and paired it alongside Figtree (regular) and Fraunces (soft, bolded) for the headers.</p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure><img alt="/" src="/static/media/typo.e9f0b4a97133355f23e9.png" class="w-[800px]"><figcaption class="pb-4 text-center text-sm">Figure 3. Potential typography choices</figcaption></figure></div><p class="pb-5">Determining colours definitely took the longest; we went through many different colours schemes but ultimately decided on a <span class="font-bold">palette that was loosely based off the primary colours of corporate WSIB</span>. We looked at WSIB's colour palette, and looked at different tints, shades, and tones to create new primary colours for the lab. We settled on variants of blue as the lab's main colour, as it was easier to work with for colour and contrast accessibility in comparison to green. Afterwards, we paired up the blues with secondary colours and accents for light and dark modes to give the lab its own unique look, while still maintaining rooted within WSIB. We also examined the colour contrast for different pairings to <span class="font-bold">ensure all use cases met WCAG AA or AAA standards.</span></p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure><img alt="/" src="/static/media/lab colours.8025cd53c92cf516ee36.png" class="w-[800px]"><figcaption class="text-center text-sm">Figure 4.

We explored a lot of different visual styles (neobrutalism, metamodernism, minimalism, to name a few), and ultimately decided on a pastel-picasso style, with some bauhaus and moving line accents.</p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure class="w-[900px] object-contain"><img alt="/" src="/static/media/initial explore.3e5632cc90aaebee647f.png"><figcaption class="pb-4 text-center text-sm">Figure 5. Brainstorming and explorations of different styles</figcaption></figure></div><p class="pb-5">Ultimately, we decided on a <span class="font-bold">pastel-picasso style, with some bauhaus and dynamic line accents</span>, as we felt they captured the lab's values really well; the dynamic lines show that the lab is always in motion, whether that be the projects and proof of concepts we develop, our sprints, or the overall growth that happens in the lab. The bauhaus tiles show how the lab often works with abstract ideas and concepts, and the pastel-picasso aesthetics demonstrate the lab's playful side, because <span class="font-bold">innovation starts with curiosity and well, having fun!</span></p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure class="object-contain"><img alt="/" src="/static/media/finalstyle.58f124eab2c478749e81.png" class="w-[1200px]"><figcaption class="pb-4 text-center text-sm">Figure 6. Final style and aesthetics</figcaption></figure></div><p class="pb-5">Logo ideation was a bit difficult due to some restrictions; the logo needed to work alongside the corporate WSIB logo, so visual balance and sizing of elements was really important. <span class="font-bold">We decided to have two logos;</span> one that would only be paired with the corporate WSIB logo, and an alternate one that could be used with the corporate logo, or as a standalone.</p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure><img alt="/" src="/static/media/logos.431a2786ae3514a3d22d.png" class="w-[1200px]"><figcaption class="pb-4 text-center text-sm">Figure 7.

Since we did most of the lo-fi/exploration work earlier, we had a good idea of what we wanted for the hi-fi mockups. First, we sorted out the information architecture for the new site using feedback from our earlier survey.</p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure><img alt="/" src="/static/media/Info Arch.654b6bdf9ddab53474b5.png" class="w-[1200px]"><figcaption class="pb-4 text-center text-sm">Figure 8.

After completing the prototypes for the designs, we had finished the lab rebrand!</p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure><img alt="/" src="/static/media/websitemock.821ceb1bb3f368261146.png" class="w-[1200px]"><figcaption class="pb-4 text-center text-sm">Figure 9.

Leveraging low/no code solutions had a lot of benefits: it would allow the design team to cover the majority of work to maintain the website, such as pushing updates to projects and cohorts, as well as allow the possibility to create proof of concepts without needing extensive resources from the development team. The next steps we noted were making the designs live, as well as implementing the new sections of the website that were listed in the information architecture.</p><p class="pb-5">Reflecting back on this project, it definitely had a lot of firsts; the team had a lot of creative freedom and ability to explore different designs; I thought we did quite well in general, one thing I would've done different would be to establish what we wanted out of the designs at first, and then explored what features and styles we could use afterwards. I think we did a really good job at justifying the final decisions we made, but we often had a variety of designs first, and then tried to pick and choose aspects and see if we could fit certain themes to them, by having a more definitive list I think we could've differentiated the more feasible designs faster which would've also helped when we were deliberating which direction to go.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="text-kinda-white bg-default-bg w-full text-center p-3 font-custom text-lg items-center h-auto pt-20 pb-10"><p class="font-headers font-light text-xl pb-3">designed and created by bryan <span class="text-text-purple">yam</span></p><div class="flex w-full place-content-center gap-5"><div><a href="mailto:b2yam@uwaterloo.ca" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"><path d="M21.75 6.75v10.5a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.25 2.25h-15a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.25-2.25V6.75m19.5 0A2.25 2.25 0 0019.5 4.5h-15a2.25 2.25 0 00-2.25 2.25m19.5 0v.243a2.25 2.25 0 01-1.07 1.916l-7.5 4.615a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.36 0L3.32 8.91a2.25 2.25 0 01-1.07-1.916V6.75" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></a></div><div><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanyam/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="h-5 w-5" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M4.98 3.5c0 1.381-1.11 2.5-2.48 2.5s-2.48-1.119-2.48-2.5c0-1.38 1.11-2.5 2.48-2.5s2.48 1.12 2.48 2.5zm.02 4.5h-5v16h5v-16zm7.982 0h-4.968v16h4.969v-8.399c0-4.67 6.029-5.052 6.029 0v8.399h4.988v-10.131c0-7.88-8.922-7.593-11.018-3.714v-2.155z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div></div></body></html>
