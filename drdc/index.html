Since we were running the experiment using VR, I also set up some VR equipment so I could run tests on my designs later on and see what the participants would see. The team set a 1km x 1km restriction for each level since our in-game model was created to mimic a walking pace. Each level would have guide markers for participants to follow as well as hidden targets that would need to be identified as they progressed through the terrain.</p></div></div><div class="mx-6 md:mx-24 lg:mx-60"><div class="pb-4 md:pb-10 lg:pb-16"><h2 class="font-heading text-hover-purple">Lo-Fi Mockups</h2><h1 class="font-headers text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl pb-5">Creating a game that looks straight from the early 2000's</h1><p class="pb-5 leading-relaxed">Now that I had the project fundamentals down, I started exploring my options for world-building. I used free third-party Unity assets alongside Unity's built-in terrain feature to create basic levels in different environments; Initially, <span class="font-bold">I fleshed out 4 different levels, each with a unique rural terrain.</span> They varied in height, object density, and opacity to help test the augmented reality elements in a variety of situations. They contained set markers, different targets, and an overall path that each participant would follow.</p><p class="leading-relaxed pb-5">Since these were "lo-fi" designs, the <span class="font-bold">main focus was on functionality</span>; making sure the game rendered all the different environment aspects properly (my very first design had some floating trees and places where you could fall off the map), and that the built-in data readers were getting accurate information while users were walking through and completing tasks.</p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure><img alt="/" src="/static/media/2000.f02485eedfd0a9eef250.png" class="w-[800px]"><figcaption class="text-center text-sm">Figure 1.

The most important piece of feedback I got was to make sure <span class="font-bold">my designs were standardized to ensure they didn't influence the data</span>. I was in the Air Cadet program for about 6 years, but most of my experience with military scenarios still came from video games, so my perception of what to include in each level was very skewed. I definitely needed to tone down some of the features in my designs. For example, in one of the lo-fi mockups I put a mountain to scale, but this would've led to way too many variables to account for and I worked to scale back any aspects that I thought would deter from the main objective of the simulation, which was to accurately identify targets and follow a set path.</p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure><img alt="/" src="/static/media/trail.21ada60d518d7a77f68a.png" class="w-[1000px]"><figcaption class="text-center text-sm">Figure 2.

There were a lot of really cool stories and it definitely helped me not only understand the physical environments they worked in, but also the psychological aspects of missions.</p><div><p class="font-bold text-sm md:text-lg pb-2 w-full text-center">Key Insights</p><div class="grid"><div class="flex justify-center md:mx-24 lg:mx-48"><div class="grid gap-2"><p>1.

Waypoint markers should be placed at a roughly equal distance and within areas that are intuitive to traverse.</p><p>4. There are certain patterns that soldiers tend to follow in the field, using these patterns would help make our participants more comfortable and would bring more focus to the goals of the experiment, rather than analyzing their walking patterns.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="mx-6 md:mx-24 lg:mx-60"><div class="pb-4 md:pb-10 lg:pb-16"><h2 class="font-heading text-hover-purple">Hi-Fi Mockups</h2><h1 class="font-headers text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl pb-5">Adding the finishing touches</h1><p class="pb-5 leading-relaxed">After compiling all the great insights I received from the interviews/testing and creating a list of action items, I started implementing them. I added some better tree line structure to match the pathways; as you can imagine, if you're trying not to be seen and looking for targets, using cover would be smart and making the trial markers reflect that helped with the realism.</p><p class="pb-5 leading-relaxed"><span class="font-bold">The last major design addition was the ability to set environmental factors.</span> Using a Unity environment pack, I set up some variables that could be adjusted to test each level at different times of the day, and different types of weather.

I looked at aspects like occlusion culling, level of detail (LOD) for meshes, render distances etc. to try and <span class="font-bold">get the best frame rate possible while still maintaining the visual integrity of each level</span>. I had a few things going on my side; the testing environment was using RTX 3090s, so the frame rates I was getting on my end would be increased for the actual simulation. I also incorporated fog to help lessen the amount of objects that needed to be rendered.</p><p class="leading-relaxed">Since I get slight motion sickness from VR headsets, it meant a lot of struggling at first as I was experimenting with a variety of different settings; which inevitably led to low frame rates and weird glitches, but in the end I was confident that if I could make it through a trial without my head spinning, it was good to go!</p></div></div><div class="mx-6 md:mx-24 lg:mx-60"><div class="pb-4 md:pb-10 lg:pb-16"><h2 class="font-heading text-hover-purple">Maps and Grids</h2><h1 class="font-headers text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl pb-5">Topping it off with some topography</h1><p class="pb-5 leading-relaxed">As a fun bonus/side project, I got to work with one of the research scientists to<span class="font-bold"> create topographic maps that be used within the minimap</span> that was within the simulation. Since the terrains for all the trials were created using Unity's built-in terrain tool, we were able to export the terrains into .raw files. These .raw files were then converted to .png files to be processed in MatLab.</p><p class="pb-5">Within Matlab, my supervisor processed the images into numbers referencing the "height" of each point in the image and we made a simple algorithm that parsed through the image, analyzing the difference between each number with a constant step size; if the difference was greater than the step size, it would place a dot for that height, and repeat on the next difference threshold. Each image was parsed 4 times; one for each side, and then combined to create the final map.</p><div class="flex place-content-center pb-5"><figure><img alt="/" src="/static/media/topo.7a86f62401ef74a34733.png" class="w-[800px]"><figcaption class="text-center text-sm">Figure 4.

In an ideal state, I would be able to cater features to users but that would lead to the addition of too many variables, potentially compromising the data. This meant I had to find the sweet spot where the flow of the simulation and its tasks were intuitive, and the data being collected was also able to be used effectively and gather actual results.</p><p class="leading-relaxed">The user interviews and testing were also an essential part of the project, not only due to the great insights I received, but also because of the empathy aspect. After the sessions, I felt like I knew a lot more about the psychology around field operations and thus did my best to make the experience as enjoyable as possible while not breaking the immersion of the game.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="text-kinda-white bg-default-bg w-full text-center p-3 font-custom text-lg items-center h-auto pt-20 pb-10"><p class="font-headers font-light text-xl pb-3">designed and created by bryan <span class="text-text-purple">yam</span></p><div class="flex w-full place-content-center gap-5"><div><a href="mailto:b2yam@uwaterloo.ca" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"><path d="M21.75 6.75v10.5a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.25 2.25h-15a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.25-2.25V6.75m19.5 0A2.25 2.25 0 0019.5 4.5h-15a2.25 2.25 0 00-2.25 2.25m19.5 0v.243a2.25 2.25 0 01-1.07 1.916l-7.5 4.615a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.36 0L3.32 8.91a2.25 2.25 0 01-1.07-1.916V6.75" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></a></div><div><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanyam/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="h-5 w-5" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M4.98 3.5c0 1.381-1.11 2.5-2.48 2.5s-2.48-1.119-2.48-2.5c0-1.38 1.11-2.5 2.48-2.5s2.48 1.12 2.48 2.5zm.02 4.5h-5v16h5v-16zm7.982 0h-4.968v16h4.969v-8.399c0-4.67 6.029-5.052 6.029 0v8.399h4.988v-10.131c0-7.88-8.922-7.593-11.018-3.714v-2.155z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div></div></body></html>
