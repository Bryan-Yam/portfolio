              <p>
                Apex Legends is a battle royale first-person shooter known for
                its fast-paced and hectic gameplay. A major factor in this is
                its interaction system; this system is used for all
                player-system interactions, such as picking up objects, building
                interactions etc.

              <p className="font-bold pb-2">Problem statement</p>
              <p>
                The interaction system in Apex currently uses one button to
                interact with all game objects. This leads to many undesired
                inputs as game objects clash with the interaction radius.

              <p>
                Creating a better interaction system allows for more accurate
                inputs, leading to more fluid and consistent gameplay.

            After some brainstorming, I thought 2 categories (combat and
            non-combat) would be best as it separates interactable objects into
            distinct categories, and doesn't make the interaction system more
            complex than needed. I chose these categories for a couple of
            reasons: the majority of interaction conflicts occur when a combat
            and non-combat object are close together. For example, when you're
            trying to open a door and pick up a weapon instead!

              Like most video games, finding a new keybind that's both ergonomic
              and available isn't the easiest. Luckily for us, Apex Legends
              already has a dedicated option for an alternative interact key.
              This makes the job a lot easier, as{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">
                one of the clusters can just be set to the alternate interact
                button, with the other cluster remaining on the default "e" key.{" "}
              </span>
              One possible issue with this would be the removal of the alternate
              key, requiring another alternate to fill its place. However, I
              think the benefits of having a more organized interaction system
              would justify the tradeoff of power users needing to adjust to
              another keybind.

              This is a tricky area to balance since radii too large can lead to

              think a{" "}

            Sorting the interactions was definitely the hardest part of this
            process. When I was originally thinking of solutions I found myself
            overcomplicating game mechanics and trying to make things as
            specific as possible since I thought the current system was too
            simple. After looking at the logistics of how many keys you could
            reasonably allocate and the additional learning it would take to
            adapt to a new system, I realized any more than 2 categories would
            just make things worse. The problem wasnâ€™t that the system was too
            simple, it was just that it needed a bit more clarity. Reflecting on
            the system, I think its simplicity is a huge benefit to the user
            experience, and adding an extra key doesn't take away from that, it
            just provides some additional support to the system.

            Sometimes it's hard to tell if what youâ€™re looking at is actually a
            problem, or if itâ€™s just that youâ€™re the problem. I have over a
            thousand hours in Apex and I was still unsure about whether this was
            a real problem. This is where research comes in; talking with
            players in-game and reading Reddit posts and articles not only
            reassures that you are looking at a real pain point but also
            provides massive insight into possible solutions and the subtle
            details of why something is an issue.
