Here's some fundamental information about the game to help you understand this case study better:</p><div class="grid"><div class="flex justify-center md:mx-24 lg:mx-48"><div class="grid gap-2"><p>1. You start the game at 100 health points and battle 7 other players (or little legends) until one is left standing.</p><p>2. Throughout the game, you obtain currency which allows you to buy units, which fight on your behalf against the other 7 players in the game.</p><p>3. Health points are lost when you lose a battle; this occurs when the opponent's units slay all of your units.</p><p>4. Damage taken is calculated based on the stage of the game and the number of remaining units your opponent has left after slaying all your units.</p><p>5. You are given approximately 30 seconds in between each battle to prepare your units, so itâ€™s important to make moves quickly. Each stage has 5 battles, with damage increasing as the stage number gets higher.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="mx-6 md:mx-16 lg:mx-60"><div class="pb-6 md:pb-10 lg:pb-16"><h2 class="font-heading text-sm md:text-base text-hover-purple">Game Breakdown and Analysis</h2><h1 class="font-headers text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl pb-5">When you have too much information for the screen, what do you do?</h1><p class="pb-5">Analyzing the information flow of the game is important for determining if anything should be removed or moved with the addition of damage numbers. For this case study, the focus will only be on the PC version of TFT, since it is more common among the player base and the mobile version has its own set of challenges due to a decrease in screen size and tech specs.</p><div class="flex place-content-center pb-5"><figure><img alt="/" class="w-[1200px]" src="/static/media/breakdown.f71a98a5347908c14bff.jpg"><figcaption class="pb-4 text-center text-sm">Figure 1.

Because of that, the option I decided to go with was following the layout of the probability tab in the bottom champion shop and creating a parallelogram that could connect to the left side of the stage/timer bar.</p><div class="flex place-content-center"><figure><img alt="/" class="w-[1200px]" src="/static/media/final.3f98773259330a6c05db.png"><figcaption class="pb-4 text-center text-sm">Figure 2.

A lot of initial ideas were based on frustrations due to bugs, or really specific occurrences that wouldnâ€™t be super meaningful to the majority of players. After a while (and through playing some TFT), I realized that you are never explicitly told how much damage you will take, and as someone who has played hundreds of games of TFT, I still donâ€™t completely know the damage numbers for each stage, so I figured that a little panel that you help you do the math would be useful, especially for newer players who have more important things to learn about the game. It helped me understand that small pain points can make a world of difference and that solving them is just as important as bigger issues.</p><p>One thing that really impressed me about the TFT information flow is how well everything is organized and presented despite the massive amount of information on the screen. For example, gold is heavily tied to champions so they are located directly together at the bottom of the screen. Wherever you look, related information is always placed together on the screen and further information is only available when you hover over something, meaning you wonâ€™t get distracted by a wall of text across the screen when you need to look at other factors for your board. Itâ€™s something that is really nuanced which I had never really noticed throughout all my games of TFT, but after analyzing the game screen a bit more I came to this realization and I think it really helped me justify my decisions for the placement of the damage indicator module.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="text-kinda-white bg-default-bg w-full text-center p-3 font-custom text-lg items-center h-auto pt-20 pb-10"><p class="font-headers font-light text-xl pb-3">designed and created by bryan <span class="text-text-purple">yam</span></p><div class="flex w-full place-content-center gap-5"><div><a href="mailto:b2yam@uwaterloo.ca" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"><path d="M21.75 6.75v10.5a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.25 2.25h-15a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.25-2.25V6.75m19.5 0A2.25 2.25 0 0019.5 4.5h-15a2.25 2.25 0 00-2.25 2.25m19.5 0v.243a2.25 2.25 0 01-1.07 1.916l-7.5 4.615a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.36 0L3.32 8.91a2.25 2.25 0 01-1.07-1.916V6.75" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></a></div><div><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanyam/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="h-5 w-5" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M4.98 3.5c0 1.381-1.11 2.5-2.48 2.5s-2.48-1.119-2.48-2.5c0-1.38 1.11-2.5 2.48-2.5s2.48 1.12 2.48 2.5zm.02 4.5h-5v16h5v-16zm7.982 0h-4.968v16h4.969v-8.399c0-4.67 6.029-5.052 6.029 0v8.399h4.988v-10.131c0-7.88-8.922-7.593-11.018-3.714v-2.155z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div></div></body></html>
