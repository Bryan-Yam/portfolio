Some categories should be regrouped together to better reflect the content flow of the dashboard.

The search bar should have more functionality, such as for phone numbers, and glossary terms. Users were also confused about whether it was a universal search bar, or page specific.</p><p>3. A majority of users struggled to locate a company that had similar names within our Maze testing, with this task having the highest drop rate.</p><p>4. Some terms and acronyms were either not used or had different names depending on the team, leading to confusion and misunderstanding amongst the participants.</p></div></div></div></div><p>The general consensus from our testing sessions was that <span class="font-bold">the dashboard was useful, but the specifics on how it would be useful varied greatly</span> between individuals across all teams. We noted multiple conflicting opinions, such as how some users prefer the current system and would have a hard time adjusting, but newer users would find the glossary and compilation of data helpful, or the amount of information that should be included; for teams that use the information, more detail is preferred, but that ends up being visual clutter for other teams who skim past it.</p></div><div class="pb-6 md:pb-10 lg:pb-16"><h2 class="font-heading text-sm md:text-base text-hover-purple">Mockups, Prototyping, and Handoff</h2><h1 class="font-headers text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl pb-5">Taking it live!

We were able to get some examples of current internal software used by our participants to reword or reformat fields in the dashboard, making a future transition to the dashboard easier, and creating a half-page design to accommodate more use cases, such as the dashboard being used in conjunction with a spreadsheet.</p><div class="flex place-content-center pb-5"><figure><img alt="/" class="w-[1200px]" src="/static/media/final.14bb9f9eba4edafa839a.png"><figcaption class="pb-4 text-center text-sm">Figure 4.

For example, one of the biggest pain points we found when performing our usability tests was a simple issue but hard to solve; each team had their own terms for the same pieces of information, so which terms would we go with? We had many different ideas; using the glossary to highlight synonyms, having the different terms appear on the dashboard itself, and seeing if one term could be standardized across different teams. Eventually, we looked at the frequency and use cases for the terms for each of the teams; since we were compiling a wealth of data, we found areas that some teams rarely interacted with and decided on naming conventions that matched the team who used the data the most. Furthermore, we also leveraged our glossary to list alternative names. It wasn't a perfect solution, but we wouldn't have realized this pain point if we didn't consider the opinions of each of the teams.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="text-kinda-white bg-default-bg w-full text-center p-3 font-custom text-lg items-center h-auto pt-20 pb-10"><p class="font-headers font-light text-xl pb-3">designed and created by bryan <span class="text-text-purple">yam</span></p><div class="flex w-full place-content-center gap-5"><div><a href="mailto:b2yam@uwaterloo.ca" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"><path d="M21.75 6.75v10.5a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.25 2.25h-15a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.25-2.25V6.75m19.5 0A2.25 2.25 0 0019.5 4.5h-15a2.25 2.25 0 00-2.25 2.25m19.5 0v.243a2.25 2.25 0 01-1.07 1.916l-7.5 4.615a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.36 0L3.32 8.91a2.25 2.25 0 01-1.07-1.916V6.75" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></a></div><div><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanyam/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><svg class="h-5 w-5" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M4.98 3.5c0 1.381-1.11 2.5-2.48 2.5s-2.48-1.119-2.48-2.5c0-1.38 1.11-2.5 2.48-2.5s2.48 1.12 2.48 2.5zm.02 4.5h-5v16h5v-16zm7.982 0h-4.968v16h4.969v-8.399c0-4.67 6.029-5.052 6.029 0v8.399h4.988v-10.131c0-7.88-8.922-7.593-11.018-3.714v-2.155z"></path></svg></a></div></div></div></div></body></html>
